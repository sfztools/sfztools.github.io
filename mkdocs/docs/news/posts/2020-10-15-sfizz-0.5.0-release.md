Big stuff:

- Added basic support for Flex EGs (#388) as modulation sources (targets to come)
- Added basic support for LFOs (#338)  as modulation sources (targets to come)
- EGs and LFOs can now target EQs and filters (#424)
- A new GUI has been added and is common to the LV2 and VST plugin (#397 #404 #419 #489 #492 #495 #496 #497); still mostly work in progress, more to come!
- Provided build systems to use sfizz with the VCV-Rack SDK and the DISTRHO Plugin Framework

New features:

- Added support for `sustain_lo` (#327)
- Audio files are now read incrementally, improving the availability under load (#294)
- A new output port for active voices has been added in the LV2 plugin (#321)
- Added support for effect types `reverb`, `disto`, `gate` and `comp`
- The voice stealing is now configurable using `hint_stealing`, with possible values as `first`, `oldest` (default), and `envelope_and_age`. The latter is the more CPU-consuming version which requires to follow the envelope of each voice to kill low-volume ones preferably. Note that the voice stealing continue to kill all voices started on the same event by default (i.e. all layers of the same note). (#344 #384 #353)
- `sfizz` now internally uses a modulation matrix to link all modulation sources (CC, LFOs, and EGs) and targets (#335 #351 #386)
- Added support for `off_time` and complete support for `off_mode`. The voice stealing logic was improved to take into account `polyphony`, `note_polyphony` and `group_polyphony` properly (#349 #352 #393 #413 #414 #467). Note that this support is also available for the engine polyphony. In this case, some additional voice will take over for the release duration (#477).
- The wavetable quality has been improved (#347)
- Support for `offset_cc` (#385)
- `sfizz_render` now supports a `--quality` switch, which acts like the `sample_quality=` opcode (#408)
- `pitch_keycenter=sample` is now taken into account (#362)
- Support `oscillator_detunecc` (#434)
- Support basic FM synthesis for oscillator regions (#436)
- CC 7, 10 and 11 are now linked by default to pan, volume and expression (#475)
- Support `hint_ram_loading` for loading the whole samples in RAM (#353)
- Support for `loop_crossfade` (#464)
- All phase-related opcodes in sfizz now use the 0->1 convention, as does ARIA/Sforzando, instead of the 0->360 convention (#499)

Issues:

- Loading probable wavetable files, or wav files containing wavetable metadata now sets `oscillator=on` on the region (#431)
- The default `sample_quality` was put back to 1 for live playing and 2 for freewheeling (#405)
- Fix an unwanted copy in the realtime thread (#334)
- Improve the filter shortcut path (#336)
- Fix the default `ampeg_attack` and `ampeg_release` to avoid clicks (#437)
- Corrected a race condition in freewheeling mode (#500)
- Fixed a potential non-realtime operation in the realtime thread (#498)
- Fix a bug when using a larger internal oversampling for regions with an `offset` value (#469)
- Fix an issue when loops occured more than once in a block (#462)
- Increase the range of the clamping on amplitude (#468) and pitch (#474)
- Fix CC modulations with their source depth set to 0 (#475)
- Fix an overshoot for crazily large cutoff values (#478); cutoffs are now clamped
- Improve the file loading logic to keep files in memory for a short while in case they get reused (#425)
- Fix the MIDNAM output for the case where extended CCs are used (#420)
- Fixed a bug where release voices where not ignored on self-mask search (#348)
- Improved the release logic in many cases (#324 #414 #413)
- Set the level of the `*noise` generator to match ARIA's (#429)
- Support for `atom:Blank` atoms in the LV2 plugin (#363)
- Fixed `amp_veltrack` behavior (#371)
- Fix the ADSRH envelope release rate (#376)
- Fixed an error for files where the loop spans the entire file (#378)
- Fixed `sustain_cc` behavior (#377)
- Match the default volumes with ARIA (#381)
- Properly set the `loop_mode` for release regions (#379)
- Regions with `end=0` are now properly disabled (#380)
- Fix `fil_random` to be bipolar (#452)
- The `sequence` order now properly starts at 1 (#451)
- Fix an issue on Flush to Zero on some ARM platforms (#455)
- Fix `pitch_veltrack` (#461)
- Opcode values now properly stop at the `<` character (#439)
- Fix various build errors and issues on all platforms (#345 #401 #400 #399 #417 #447 #449 #443 #453 #456 #459 #471 #484 #487 #488 #491)
- The file dialog initial directory is now the root of the current loaded file (#428)
- Existing and known CC values are now correctly taken into account for modulations (#421)
- Fix various performance regressions and improved performance especially on ARM builds (#410 #412 #415 #426)

API changes:

- Added API support for setting the playback state, time position and signature (#354)
- The API documentation on the sfizz's website has been streamlined alot !
