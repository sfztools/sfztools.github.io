New supports and plugins:

- Added a Puredata plugin (#869 #873 #874)
- Added support for `hint_sustain_cancels_release`, which when activated reproduces a LinuxSampler behavior by sustaining already released notes (#898). A GUI option should come later.
- Added support for `amp_veltrack_oncc`, `pitch_veltrack_oncc`, and `fil_veltrack_oncc` (#938)
- Dynamic EGs are supported for flex EGs (#933 #932 #930)
- Support `_curvecc` for extended CCs (#993)
- Support `lorand` and `hirand` on CC-triggered regions (#997)
- The engine now parses `oscillator=auto` and only enables oscillators on short samples with wavetable tags in the WAV metadata (#954)

Bug fixes and other improvements:

- Added a GUI volume meter (#859)
- Implement support for VST3 keyswitch and midi note names (#877 #876)
- Fixed a bug which could prevent parameters to be automated in Ardour (#893)
- Fixed a bug where high definition CC, crossfade or aftertouch events could be ignored (#855 #896)
- Resetting all controllers will now reset them to their default, instead of 0 (#905)
- Filter resonance can now be negative (#919)
- Corrected a bug for the LV2 plugin when used in the Ardour DAW (#924)
- Respect the editor set for sfz files on MacOS (#925)
- The JACK and PureData clients can use custom importers (#926)
- Fix `off_by` behavior with long-releasing notes (#972)
- Polyphony groups can have negative indices (#934)
- Parse `lokey=-1` as `hikey=-1` (#941)
- Improved the preloading for monolithic wave files (#935)
- Since the default build of the LV2 plugin is not statically linked against libsndfile, the distribution license is changed to the ISC license (#943)
- The DecentSampler importer now better translates the loop modes (#981)
- Even when plugin-side automation is disabled (through `SFIZZ_LV2_PSA`), sustain and sostenu CC events will still go through to the plugin to improve the user experience on hosts that do not support automatic mapping of control ports to midi events through the LV2 `midi:binding` extension (#963).
- Fixed a bug that could hang the background thread in the VST plugin (#984 #865 #864)
- The current keyswitch is properly saved and restored with the plugin state (#961)
- It is now possible to enter values for CCs on the plugin GUI by double clicking on the CC knob (#945). A high-resolution input option is also available on a right click.
- Added a text interface to `sfizz_jack` (#973)
- CC-triggered voices can be cut off by polyphony groups (#917)
- Allow building on MacOS 10.9 (#990)
- Improved the X11 runloop (#986)
- Added a polyphony option to `sfizz_render` (#992)
- Corrected a bug which prevented VST3 or LV2 plugins to be loaded by the Ardour DAW (#995)
- Corrected a bug where octave and note offset were not reset upon loading a new file (#994)
- Corrected a bug where CC-triggered voices could generate note-offs when cut by a polyphony group (#998)
- Added man pages for `sfizz_render` and `sfizz_jack` (#999)
- Various build system improvements for different platforms (#957 #958 #964 #967 #968 #989 #978 #942 #921 #920 #902 #849 #850 #856 #1001)
