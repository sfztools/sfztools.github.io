## Global view

The sfizz engine is basically a "Synth" object that takes an SFZ file in,
receives MIDI-type events and is able to render audio through successive calls
to a callback function. This is in line with the way most audio applications and
plugins are working. A high-level overview is presented in the following diagram.

```

1. Built from the SFZ file<br><br>
Each region is a semi-passive description object that can decide
whether it is "active" or not depending on the chain
of MIDI events it receives.
Once activated, a voice is
chosen to play the region until
it ends naturally or through
note-offs or off-groups.

2. There are a number of common resources that are needed for all the regions
and in particular the voices.
This includes all the (preloaded) files for the SFZ instrument, but will include
in the future the EG and LFOs that are needed to achieve compliance
with the SFZ v2 specification. This will also include a temporary buffer holder
that voices may share.
A common resource of importance is the MIDI state: note durations are needed
for some opcodes -- for example rt_decay -- and triggering velocities too.

3. The voices are the polyphony of the synth. They are idle
and they get activated by the synth to play a region on a specific event.
They are then "linked" to the region while it is played,
and reset to their idle state when they are done playing the region.

The Synth, Voices and Regions form the bulk of the code complexity. The rest of
the engine is dedicated of mostly helper classes to enable easy management of
floating-point buffers in which the audio data is held, signal processing and
accelerated (SIMD) computations, and abstractions that are specific to the SFZ
format such as envelope generators, curves or LFOs.

## Parsing the SFZ files

The sfz file logic is pretty simple and well defined.
The <https://sfzformat.com> website contains an extensive documentation on it.
At its core, an SFZ file describes a list of `region` objects on which a certain
number of "opcodes" will apply. Opcodes can determine the sample played,
the event conditions that will trigger the sample such as the range of notes,
channels, velocities, the processing to apply on the sample while playing,
and many more things. It is also possible to describe a `group` of regions,
as well as exclusive groups that will shut off other regions that may already
be playing. There are also `master` groups, and `global` opcodes
and some other types.

All the opcodes are declared within a header, in a pseudo-xml markup language
that looks like this:

```sfz
<global> volume=6
<control> set_cc4=5
<region> key=36 sample=kick.wav
```

Here we have 3 headers (`global`, `control` and `region`) and each header holds
some opcodes. All of these opcodes have a value --- for example the volume
is equal to 6 in the `global` header. Some opcodes also have parameters.
The `control` header holds an opcode `set_cc` with the parameter `4` and value `5`.
The parameter here is the CC to set, and the value at which to set it is 5.

The parsing logic of sfizz is handled through a base class called Parser --- a
very original choice. This parser has a virtual callback that gets called
whenever a header description is "complete", along with a list of opcodes that
apply to the header. Subclassing the Parser then allows to build different
SFZ handlers, from full-blown synths as with sfizz to simpler things such as
printers (see in particular <https://github.com/sfztools/sfz-flat/>). If we look
at the core of the latter example, it will look something like the following:

```cpp
class PrintingParser: public sfz::Parser
{
protected:
    void callback(absl::string_view header, const std::vector<sfz::Opcode>& members) final
    {
        switch (hash(header)) // The hash(...) function transforms strings to large integers
        {
        case hash("global"): // It is also compile-time defined, which allows to do switch-case
                             // statements on strings, something that is usually not possible
            globalMembers = members; // We save the global headers since they apply to the next
                                     // region (and groups and masters)
            masterMembers.clear();
            groupMembers.clear();
            break;
        case hash("master"):
            masterMembers = members; // So on
            groupMembers.clear();
            break;
        case hash("group"):
            groupMembers = members; // .. and so forth
            break;
        case hash("region"):
            std::cout << "<" << header << ">" << ' '; // Now we print the region along with all the opcodes
                                                      // we memorized from earlier headers.
            printMembers(globalMembers);
            printMembers(masterMembers);
            printMembers(groupMembers);
            printMembers(members);
            std::cout << '\n';
            break;
        default:
            std::cout << "<" << header << ">" << ' ';
            printMembers(members);
            std::cout << '\n';
            break;
        }
    }
private:
    std::vector<sfz::Opcode> globalMembers;
    std::vector<sfz::Opcode> masterMembers;
    std::vector<sfz::Opcode> groupMembers;
    void printMembers(const std::vector<sfz::Opcode>& members)
    {
        for (auto& member: members)
        {
            std::cout << member.opcode;
            if (member.parameter)
                std::cout << +*member.parameter;
            std::cout << "=" << member.value;
            std::cout << ' ';
        }
    }
};
```

The main function is then quite straightforward and we call a function
from the Parser class that loads a file

```cpp
PrintingParser parser;
parser.loadSfzFile("my_sfz_file.sfz");
```

If you circle back to the parser you will see that opcodes are stored in an
`Opcode` class. This class does some parsing itself and separates the opcode
name itself, parameters if any, and the value. Opcodes are very cheap to copy
and pass around because they only refer to characters in the file that are stored
inside the `Parser` class, so feel free to create vectors of them and move them
around.

Note that you may also derive the [loadSfzFile()] method if you have
any processing you need to do before the actual parsing happens.

## Building the region list in sfizz

The callback method from sfizz is actually quite similar to the one shown above,
except that instead of printing the region we actually fill a big structure from it.
